        <h2>Termination clause</h2>
        
        <p>A termination clause is a provision in a contract that outlines the circumstances under which the agreement can be terminated. This clause can be used to end a contract early without breaching the terms of the agreement. Termination clauses can be customized, but standard ones are included in almost every agreement 12.<br><br>


Termination for convenience: This type of clause allows either party to terminate the contract without any specific reason.
Termination for cause: This type of clause allows either party to terminate the contract if the other party breaches any of the provisions of the agreement 1.
It is important to negotiate these terms carefully with an attorney to ensure that they are enforceable and fair 1.
